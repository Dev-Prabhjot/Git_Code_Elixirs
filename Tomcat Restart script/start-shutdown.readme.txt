# Tomcat Start-shutdown Scriptlways causing effort to double

Problem: While executing test cases our testing team used to face problem of "Tomcat server crash" hence application on QA server used to get down frequently.This which eventually obstructed their work 
always causing efforts to get double and delay in work.

Solution:The following script was proposed as solution to deal with problem such that the downtime of application decreases and there is no delay in work

Following script : 1. checks Server status up or down through process id and https call .
		   2. If server is up and running then shuts it down ,cleans cache and tarts tomcat server
		   3. If server is down then cleans cache and Start tomcat server.
The script is called using Jenkins Polling feature after every 30min to decrease the application downtime hence triggered through jenkins build.
